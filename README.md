Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to the Constant Correlation Model (CCM) for optimal portfolio formation and Expected Shortfall (ES) risk measurement. In this project, I delved into the world of portfolio optimization and risk assessment.
This repository showcases my proficiency in utilizing CCM as a tool for correlation-based portfolio optimization. I also implemented the ES method to gauge potential losses beyond Value at Risk (VaR). The repository is accompanied by a detailed Jupyter notebook (or R script), providing insights into my analytical process.
As a data enthusiast, I am committed to advancing my skills and knowledge in portfolio management and risk assessment. I invite you to explore this GitHub repository and encourage discussions or collaborations in the field of data analysis and financial modeling. Your feedback and inquiries are always appreciated.
